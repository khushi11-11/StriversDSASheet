WHAT IS A PREFIX SUM?
- Itâ€™s just the running sum of elements as you move through the array.
- So for: nums = [1, 2, 3, -2, 5], The prefix sums at each index are:

Index	    Element	    Prefix Sum
0	        1	        1
1	        2	        3 (1+2)
2	        3	        6 (1+2+3)
3	        2	        4 (6 + -2)
4	        5	        9 (4 + 5)

We just keep adding as we move forward.
